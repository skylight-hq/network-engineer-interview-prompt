# Network Engineer Technical Scenario Prompt

## Overview
This exercise is designed to assess how you approach solving real-world network engineering problems in a collaborative, applied environment. The goal isn’t to see whether you reach a perfect solution but to understand your reasoning, communication style, and ability to pair effectively with other engineers.

In this session, you’ll work with a Skylight team member acting as a **junior network engineer**. They’ll be sharing their screen and walking you through the current setup while implementing your suggestions. You should guide them, explain your reasoning, and ask clarifying questions as you would in a real-world pairing session.

The interview will last about 90 minutes total:
- 5 minutes for introductions
- ~35–40 minutes for the pairing session (this exercise)
- ~35–40 minutes for open-ended discussion
- 10–15 minutes for your questions

You’re not expected to complete the entire task. We’re more interested in how you think, communicate, and collaborate.

## Scenario
The **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)** operates several data centers across the country connected by a legacy MPLS network. The network has grown organically over time, resulting in inconsistent performance, limited visibility, and challenges integrating with new cloud services (AWS GovCloud and Azure Government).

Your task is to help design an improved architecture that supports modernization goals such as:
- Increased reliability, scalability, and visibility
- Integration with cloud and hybrid environments
- Stronger security and compliance alignment (e.g., FISMA, FedRAMP)
- Sustainable operations that federal teams can maintain after deployment

During the session, the **junior network engineer** will share a simplified network diagram and a few configuration snippets representing the current environment. You’ll guide them in identifying weaknesses, suggesting improvements, and reasoning through modernization options.

Some example areas to explore:
- How would you re-architect the WAN using SD-WAN or distributed network design principles?
- How might you improve resilience, latency, and monitoring?
- What compliance and security considerations should inform the design?
- How would you help the HHS team sustain these improvements after implementation?

You’re encouraged to think aloud, explain tradeoffs, and ask questions. Remember, there is no single right answer — we’re evaluating how you reason, collaborate, and coach.

## What We’re Looking For
We’ll use this exercise to understand your:
- **Technical reasoning** – How you approach complex network design and troubleshooting
- **Collaboration and communication** – How you guide, mentor, and partner with others
- **Security and compliance mindset** – How you embed security and standards in design
- **Systems thinking** – How you balance performance, resilience, and maintainability
- **Enablement orientation** – How you prepare teams to sustain success

## Tips for Success
- Treat the interviewer like a teammate. Ask clarifying questions and share your reasoning.
- Think out loud. We value your approach more than a finished answer.
- Consider tradeoffs — cost, complexity, performance, compliance.
- Be open about uncertainty. Real-world systems are ambiguous; we care how you navigate that.

**You do not need to prepare any configuration files or network diagrams in advance.** The interviewer will provide all materials you need during the session.
